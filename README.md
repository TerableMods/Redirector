### Ghillieglade:
>1) Entering Ghillieglade: **Redirects to end of bridge facing Dominolith & Banyakas**
>2) Resetting Instances manually inside of Ghillieglade: **Redirects to Creation Workshop banker (Velika)**
>3) Breaking Ghillieglade loot chest: **Next Velik's Sanctuary entry will reset all Instances**

 ~ **Elite Status/TERA Club useful tip:**
>- After breaking the loot chest in the 1st daily entry, use the **Velik's Opportunity** scroll on your bar.
>- No point in using */reset* or the Exit Teleportal inside.
>- (This avoids uneccessary teleporting and loading screens going back for your 2nd entry)
>- The module automatically resets all Instances for you before your 2nd entry begins.
>- After your 2nd entry is completed, you can */reset* inside to be redirected to the banker.
